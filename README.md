# LabMigration
Is your lab still buying expensive licences of commercial and proprietary CFD software for research and education?  Then we suggest it's time to switch to the world of free knowledge and use a nifty, free-of-cost software called OpenFOAM.  We invite faculty from all Engineering Colleges to come forward and take part in Lab Migration Project.
